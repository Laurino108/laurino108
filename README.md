I write back-end applications in C# and modern front-ends using JavaScript In my spare time I also program various Discord bots with discord.js
My working model is very simple and only makes sense for me as a developer who likes to experiment: you build it you run it.
In my daily work as a junior developer I work with C# as mentioned at the beginning.
